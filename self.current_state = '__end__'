**Error Handling:** The `engine.py` code includes error handling for cases such as missing state functions and invalid return values from state functions.

**In summary:** This design provides a robust and flexible way to define and execute state machines.  The use of a DOT graph for the workflow structure and a separate class for state logic promotes clear separation of concerns and makes the system easy to understand and modify. The asynchronous nature of the engine allows for efficient handling of user input and other I/O operations. The addition of state overrides and condition-based transitions provides powerful control over the workflow execution.
